## 🗣️ Talking Points

### If asked about AI integration:
> "Currently, the frontend uses a simulated AI response for demo purposes. The architecture is ready to integrate with OpenAI, Claude, or any LLM API. The backend will handle the actual workflow generation logic."

### If asked about n8n integration:
> "We're using the n8n-MCP SDK for workflow management. The frontend sends user requests to the backend, which uses AI to generate n8n-compatible workflow JSON, then creates the workflow via the n8n API."

### If asked about scalability:
> "The frontend is built with Next.js, which scales excellently. We can deploy to Vercel with edge functions for global performance. The component architecture is modular and maintainable."

### If asked about monetization:
> "We envision a freemium model: free tier for basic workflows, paid tiers for advanced features like team collaboration, premium templates, and higher usage limits."

### If asked about competition:
> "While tools like Zapier and Make exist, they still require manual configuration. WorkflowAI is unique in using AI to generate complete workflows from natural language, making automation truly accessible to everyone."
